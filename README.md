# Twenty_Questions
A C++ program designed in my CS270 Data Structures class at Whitman, it is an implementation of a game similar to twenty questions. 
While the bones were given to us, the actual implementation was done by me. The intention of the project was to gain experience
manipulating trees. The game starts with the question: "Are you thinking of a Polar Bear?", and the user has the option of saying yes 
or no. If the user says no, then a new child is added and the tree is reorganized to accomadate it.
